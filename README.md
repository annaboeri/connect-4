# Connect 4

## A retro take on the classic Milton Bradley Game

(/images/Connect4ScreenShot.png)

#### Objective
Players take turns dropping colored disks into the top of a 7 column, 6 row grid. The object of the game is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagnoal line of four.

#### Technologies Used
Javascript, JQuery, HTML5, CSS3, SweetAlert

#### User Stories
As a player, I should be ale to choose what color disk I have.

As a player, I should be able to see if I win or lose with a display message

As a player, I should be able to restart the game and play a new game

As a user, I want the game to have sound effects and animation to make it more exciting


#### Approach
Documented using [Trello] (https://trello.com/b/Y4wQH05J/wdi-project-1-connect-4) 

#### Outstanding Challenges
Attempted to animate the board to look like the disks were sliding down the column but failed to integrate the effect properly into my code base without breaking other featues
