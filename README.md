### Objective
Players take turns dropping colored disks into the top of a 7 column, 6 row grid. The object of the game is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagnoal line of four disks.

### Technologies Used
Javascript, JQuery, HTML5, CSS3

### User Stories
* As a player, I should be able to choose what color disk I have.

* As a player, I should be able to see if I win or lose with a display message.

* As a player, I should be able to restart the game and play a new game.

* As a player, I want the game to have sound effects and animation to make it more exciting.

### Outstanding Challenges

* Attempted to animate the board to look like the disks were sliding down the column but failed to integrate the effect properly into my code base without breaking other features

* Also need to add functionality that deactivates player 1's disk color selection so that player 2 cannot choose the same disk color
